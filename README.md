# build-a-bot
Work with your team to build a bot (command line app)


Many sites such as Amazon.com now use chat bots that respond to user inquiries and provide information to help troubleshoot or link you to a part of the site you may be looking for.

We are going to build a similar functionality using NodeJS to take in user input, analyze it and give a response.  Be creative with this.  Your bot should ask follow up questions based on the user's previous response.
